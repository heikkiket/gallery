# photos
## A simple photo library

This photo library is meant to be a minimalistic, simple and plain-text centric tool for your personal photo management.

This project has three parts:

 * specification for a simple photo library
 * command line tool for managing photo library
 * simple graphical program for managing photo library

## Useful links
Before we hop to all that, here's some links that give you a quick jump to other parts of documentation

## library specification

Your photo library is just a directory tree containing pictures plus a library.toml file. An example directory tree could look like this:
```
~/Pictures/gallery/
├── 2021
│   └── 12
│       └── 15
│           └── image1.png
├── 2022
│   ├── 01
│   │   └── 15
│   │       └── image2.png
│   └── 03
│       └── 02
│           └── image3.jpg
└── library.toml
```

In this photo library pictures are organized to `year-month-day` directory structure. You can use whatever structure you want, of course.

### library.toml fileformat

All the metadata is saved to a library.toml file. It looks like this:

```
["Wallpapers/Studio_Ghibli_Laputa_Laputa_Castle_in_the_Sky_Movie_Screenshots_far_view_anime_animated_movies-1845525.jpg"]
title = ""
description = ""
tags = ['movie', 'Laputa']

["holiday pictures/IMG_20220301_130811.jpg"]
title = "In the forest"
description = ""
tags = ['nature', 'forest']

["holiday pictures/IMG_20220301_132625.jpg"]
title = "A huge tree"
description = ""
tags = ['nature', 'tree', forest]

["holiday pictures/IMG_20220301_132650.jpg"]
title = "Nice rock"
description = "This is a nice rock I found"
tags = ['nature', 'rock']

```

Basically you just reference every image with its path and then give it title, description and tags. This file is easy to write by hand and pretty human-readable as well, but you can also generate and handle it automatically.

The idea here is that the whole library.toml is easily hackable so you (or others) can extend the system however you like.

## photos command

![Picture of photos command line tool](./docs/screenshots/photos-cmd.png)

There is a simple, alpha-level utility called `photos` that can be used to manipulate this photo library. Currently it has following functions.

 * init
 * list
 * add
 * edit

The basic idea with this command and all these utilities is similar to for example Git: you use this command at the root of your image library. For example, if your images reside in `~/Photos/test_image_library`, then you will run all these commands in that directory.

In that same directory resides your `library.toml` file.

### photos list
This command lists all the pictures in the library.toml. It checks that every image really exists on the disk and prints out *** FILE MISSING *** for ones that don't exist. Just go to the directory where library.toml sits and issue this command there.

You can also filter pictures by tag:

`photos list --tag nature`
This gives you a list of all pictures tagged "nature".

### photos init
This command creates a new library.toml by collecting all the image files from the current work directory and its subdirectories. It does not save the file anywhere but only prints its contents out. You can easily create a library.toml file by piping results into file. Following command overwrites an earlier library.toml.

```
photos init > library.toml
```

### photos add
This command adds a new file into library.toml file.
One can define title, description or tags for an image by using this. Only filename is a mandatory argument.

    photos add -t "My image title" -d "A description for this image" --tags tag1 tag2 tag3 my_image.jpg

### photos edit
With this you can edit image in a photo library. The command syntax is basically identical with add command.

    photos edit -t "My edited image title" -d "A new description" --tags newtag1 tag1 tag2 tag3 my_image.jpg

If you only want to edit for example title, just give that argument like so:

    photos edit -t "My edited image title" my_image.jpg

## photo-viewer (GTK)

![Picture of photo-viewer](./docs/screenshots/photo-viewer.png)

photo-viewer is a simple GTK-based program that can be started from command line and used to view images in the library. Start the program in the same directory that contains a library.toml file.

Actually, photo-viewer allows also editing image metadata. So you can do quick fixes to your image library with it!

In order to function photo-viewer needs python3 installed in the host system as well as PyGobject library.
